Healthcare Provider Fraud Detection
========================================

Provider Fraud is one of the biggest problems facing Medicare. According to the government, the total Medicare spending increased exponentially due to frauds in medicare claims .
Healthcare fraud is organized crime which involves peers of providers,physicians ,beneficiaries acting together to make fraud claims.

Healthcare Provider Fraud solution offers an insight into how RapidCanvas users and solution providers can build an end to end solution on the notebook interface and view the same on the UI

Problem Statement
========================================


The goal of this project is to " predict the potentially fradulent providers " based on the claims filed by them.Along with this, we will also discover important variables helpful in detecting behaviour of potentially fraud providers.
Further, we will study fradulent patterns in provider's claims to understand future behaviour of providers.

Rigorous analysis of Medicare data has yielded many physicians who indulge in fraud.They adopt ways in which an ambiguous diagnosis code is ussed to adopt costliest procedures and drugs.
Insurance companies are most vulnerable institutions impacted due to this bad practices.Due to this reason, insurance companies increased their insurance premiums and as a result healthcare is becoming costly matter day by day.

Business Goals

Solution
========================================
``Define how you solved this problem``

To help RapidCanvas users build solutions easily on the platform, a 2 fold approach has been used:

* Provide a pre built solution and the corresponding notebook interface to the users
* Provide a pre built solution reference documentation

This help new users go through solution building end to end with instructions directly on the notebook and see the output on the UI as they run through the cells. 

The reference documentation provides an outline of what to create as part of the solution documentation with examples and syntax


Implementation
========================================
``Provide high level details of your implementation``

Notebook Implementation
----------------------------

Here is a reference notebook which users can use.  `Building a Solution on RapidCanvas <https://docs.dev.rapidcanvas.net/buildingasolution.html>`_

Solution Documentation
----------------------------

Here is the reference documentaton which users can use. `Creating documentation for a solution <https://docs.dev.rapidcanvas.net/sample_projects/employee/doc/info.html>`_

Outcome
========================================

We can try to understand below the frauderant behaviour with respect to chats which have plotted from our data transfrom process.

   -  Distribution of BENEFICIARIES based on GENDER 
.. image:: 1.png

      -  From the above plot, we can decude that the ratio b/w GENDER_0 : GENDER_1 is 57% : 43%.

   -  Distribution of BENEFICIARIES based on Alive or Dead Status.
.. image:: 2.png
   
      -  The above graph tells us that almost 99% of the beneficiaries are ALIVE and very small percentage of patients are DEAD. It would be good to see how much this feature has impact on the actual label.

   -  Distribution of BENEFICIARIES AGE
.. image::  3.png

      -  The above graph tells us that the majority of the beneficiaries are b/w 65 to 85 years.

   -  Distribution of BENEFICIARIES on the basis of Human RACE.
.. image::  4.png

      -  The above graph tells us that there is a serious imbalance in the records for Human Race categories.

   -  Imbalance of males and females across the human races
.. image::  5.png

      -  The above graph shows us whether we have an imbalance of males or females across the human races. And, it looks like within a specific human race there is no such gender imbalance.
   
   -  Distribution of BENEFICIARIES on the basis of 'ChronicCond_KidneyDisease.
.. image::  6.png

      -  Above graph tells us that around 31% of Beneficiaries had Chronic Kidney Disease. In the beneficiary dataset, we have 2 columns:
          -  RenalDisease
          -  ChronicCond_KidneyDisease Both of these columns appears to be representing the beneficiary history about the kidney disease.

   -  Imbalance b/w males and females across the human races.
.. image::  7.png

      -  In the above, we came to know that 2.94% of beneficiaries had no previously CKD but suffered from RKD. It would be good to check how many out these end-up as FRAUD claims.
